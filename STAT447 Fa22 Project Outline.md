### STAT447 Fa22 Project Outline:

#### info about previous work:

Visualize and Predict Terrorist Attacks using the Global Terrorism Database

Goal: To predict info below:

+ One attack just happened: Who did this and Why
+ Next attack: Where and How (attack/weapon types?)



1. Visualization and Analysis

   1. General infomation about global terrorist attacks.

   2. Select **10 most activate groups** (ordered by attacks number)

      Characteristics (target, weapon, time and location) of attacks by different terrorist groups.

2. Prediction:

   1. Focus on 10 groups
   2. Apriori algorithm to verify pattern we found in part1.
   3. Apply machine learning algorithm of classification to conjecture information of one attack that just happened.

3. Performance optimization

   Feature engineering, Encoding Strategy and MapReduce

#### What I did on previous work:

+ Visualization and Analysis

  **Can easily be done in R.**

+ A multi-class classification task: 

  **Several mechine learning model in python**

+ Compare performance between different models on prediction results. Reason about the difference

  **nothing but wtring**

+ Performance optimization

#### What we can do for this program:

1. Data clean (done)
2. Visualization and Analysis
3. write several models(decision tree,random F, KNN ), compare their performance, guess reasons
4. conclusion & slides pre

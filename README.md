## Team Members and Contributions

1. **Minjun Kim (minjunk2)** Built Random Forest model for predicting perpetrator and plotted line chart for attack count, have presented decision tree regression model and Random Forest models in the video.

2. **Feiran Qin (feiranq2)** Built several figures for visualization, and wrote the visualization part in the written report.

3. **Jawad Haq (jhaq2)** Built Random Forest model for predicting type of attack and presented and wrote the introduction to our overall project. Additionally, presented and wrote about the data used in the video.

4. **Yihao Zhao (yihao4)** Building the Decision Tree regression model, and plotting multiple barplots in different explanatory variables, Writing the interpretation and explanation for Decision Tree model and project's conclusion in written report and presenting it in presentation.

5. **Ziyue Yang (ziyue9)** Built several KNN models on different features and examined the performance of the model under different settings. Edited the presentation video. Contirbuted to part of report and presented it in presentation.



## Proposal

We will focus on the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). We want to find relationships of attacks such as attacks by region, corrlation between features (we can find up to 70 features such as data, weapon type, attack type). First, we do data fetching and data cleaning. Next, we visualize and correlize the data to see if we can find some rules. Finally, we will try some models such as random forest to do prediction of attacks.(Who will be responsible or When and where is the next attack)

## Plan

1. Data clean (done)
2. Visualization and Analysis
3. write several models(decision tree,random F, KNN ), compare their performance, guess reasons
4. conclusion & slides pre

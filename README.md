Start of our Projectgit proposal. Still need to discuss this with group. 
Personally, I like the 'Something New', 'Transcription' and 'replication' options from the topic list on the topic list STAT 447 page. Perhaps we can look into GSS data and see if we can find insights regarding mental health across different demographics? This would be a good option if we want to follow the somethign new option. For transcribing we can try to convert a long list of SQL queries into dplyr commands. For replication, we can try to identify consistency in findings by using other datasets to see of findings in literature are consistent.

## Proposal

We will focus on the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). We want to find relationships of attacks such as attacks by region, corrlation between features (we can find up to 70 features such as data, weapon type, attack type). First, we do data fetching and data cleaning. Next, we visualize and correlize the data to see if we can find some rules. Finally, we will try some models such as random forest to do prediction of attacks.(Who will be responsible or When and where is the next attack)

## Plan

1. Data clean (done)
2. Visualization and Analysis
3. write several models(decision tree,random F, KNN ), compare their performance, guess reasons
4. conclusion & slides pre

Start of our Project proposal. Still need to discuss this with group. 
Personally, I like the 'Something New', 'Transcription' and 'replication' options from the topic list on the topic list STAT 447 page. Perhaps we can look into GSS data and see if we can find insights regarding mental health across different demographics? This would be a good option if we want to follow the somethign new option. For transcribing we can try to convert a long list of SQL queries into dplyr commands. For replication, we can try to identify consistency in findings by using other datasets to see of findings in literature are consistent.
